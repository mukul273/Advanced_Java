### Imperative programming:  
This programming approach is about how a program should be executed step by step

### Declarative programming:  
This approach is about not necessarily how but what should be executed

### What is Lambda expression:
Lambda expression is an anonymous function without a name that doesn't belong to any class.

    Method                  |           Lambda Expression
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Name                    |           No Name
    Parameters List         |           Parameters list
    Body                    |           Body (main part)
    return type             |           No return type(JVM infers the return type by scanning the code)               
    
    General Syntax
    ()              ->          { }
    Lambda         Arrow        Lambda 
    Input          denoting     Body
    Parameters     Lambda

Any interface with Single Abstract method is a functional interface and implementation may be treated as lambda expression

```@FunctionalInterface``` annotation denotes that method can be treated as lambda expression.  
Functional interface have default and static methods which have an implementation  

### Consumer interface: 
It is a part of java.util.function package  
It takes one argument and produces the result, it doesn't return any result  

### BiConsumer Interface
It takes two arguments, BiConsumer does not return value. 

### Predicate interface:  
It's a single argument function that returns true or false

### BiPredicate interface:  
It's a functional interface which accepts two argument and returns Boolean value.  
Apply business logic for the values passed as an argument and return the boolean value.

### Function Interface
It takes one argument and produces results.

### BiFunction Interface
It takes two arguments and produces results.  
While declaring BiFunction we need to tell what type of argument will be passed and what will be 
return type. We can apply our business logic with those two values and return the result.

### UnaryOperator Interface
It's an interface where the operand and result are of same type. It extends from Function interface.
There are IntUnaryOperator, LongUnaryOperator and DoubleUnaryOperator types.

## BinaryOperator Interface
It takes two params and return single value  
Both params must be of same type so is return type  
Generally used for mathematical use cases  
IntBinaryOperator, LongBinaryOperator, DoubleBinaryOperator are specific interfaces
