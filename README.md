### Imperative programming:  
This programming approach is about how a program should be executed step by step

### Declarative programming:  
This approach is about not necessarily how but what should be executed

### What is Lambda expression:
Lambda expression is an anonymous function without a name that doesn't belong to any class.

    Method                  |           Lambda Expression
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Name                    |           No Name
    Parameters List         |           Parameters list
    Body                    |           Body (main part)
    return type             |           No return type(JVM infers the return type by scanning the code)               
    
    General Syntax
    ()              ->          { }
    Lambda         Arrow        Lambda 
    Input          denoting     Body
    Parameters     Lambda

Any interface with Single Abstract method is a functional interface and implementation may be treated as lambda expression

```@FunctionalInterface``` annotation denotes that method can be treated as lambda expression.  
Functional interface have default and static methods which have an implementation  

### Consumer interface: 
It is a part of java.util.function package  
It takes one argument and produces the result
